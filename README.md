# reactor-testing

This repository allows you to test your EVRYTHNG Reactor scripts on your local
machine, and simulates one of the possible types of events that a Reactor script
can receive.


##Â How to use

1. `$ git clone https://github.com/evrythng/reactor-testing`

2. `$ cd reactor-testing`

3. Replace `main.js` with the Reactor script to be tested.

4. Insert your Operator API key in `runner.js` as the value of 
   `OPERATOR_API_KEY`.

5. Choose the type of event to simulate, and the file to be used as that event
   object at the top of `runner.js`. This file must contain valid values for the 
  various entity IDs involved.

6. `$ node runner.js`
